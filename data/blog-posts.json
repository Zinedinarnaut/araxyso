    "content": "The Apple Foundation Course was an intensive three-week program focused on design and coding, where my team and I collaborated to develop a fully functional iOS application using SwiftUI in Xcode.\n\nTeam & Roles\nI worked in a team of four, with a dynamic and flexible structure:\n\n2/3 researchers who gathered insights, defined user needs, and shaped the problem space.\n1 programmer (me) responsible for implementing the app in SwiftUI/Xcode and ensuring its functionality.\n4 designers, including myself, focused on UI/UX design, prototyping, and refining the app’s look and feel.\nCourse Phases\nWeek 1: Design & Research\n\nUsed Miro for brainstorming, wireframing, and planning the user experience.\nConducted research and ideation to define the app’s core functionality.\nDeveloped high-fidelity UI/UX prototypes.\nWeek 2: Coding & Development\n\nTransitioned from design to development, implementing the app using SwiftUI in Xcode.\nFocused on UI implementation, app logic, and debugging.\nIterated based on feedback to refine the user experience.\nWeek 3: Finalization & Presentation\n\nPolished the app by optimizing UI, fixing bugs, and preparing for launch.\nPrepared a presentation showcasing our design process, technical implementation, and final product.\nGraduated from the program with a final pitch and demonstration of our application.\nKey Takeaways\nGained hands-on experience in collaborative app development, from ideation to final implementation.\nStrengthened skills in SwiftUI, Xcode, and UI/UX design principles.\nLearned the importance of team dynamics and cross-functional collaboration in app development.",
